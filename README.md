## Background

Noise in images often obstructs meaningful analysis, particularly in scientific imaging. This project aims to tackle the challenge of denoising images using a variety of techniques, including:  

- **Traditional methods**: Gaussian Filtering, Median Filtering, Non-Local Means (NL-Means), TV-Chambolle, Wavelet filtering.  
- **Advanced methods**: TV-ISO, BM3D, and deep learning-based models (Noise2Noise and Noise2Void).  

Our primary objective is to evaluate and improve denoising techniques, contributing to the advancement of image processing for scientific applications.  

This project is also inspired by the [AI4Life Challenge](https://ai4life-mdc24.grand-challenge.org/ai4life-mdc24/), which focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance image quality in biological research. While the challenge is no longer active, it provided a compelling framework for exploring state-of-the-art denoising methods. If the challenge was still open, participation in it would have been a valuable opportunity to benchmark the project's outcomes and contribute to the broader scientific community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for Noise2Noise and Noise2Void)
- Additional dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML4Science.git
   cd ML4Science
2. **Create** a dedicated python environnement : 
    ```bash 
        conda create -n denoising_project
        conda activate denoising_project
3. **Install** the dependencies : 
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Download** the [dataset](https://datasets.epfl.ch/w2s/W2S_raw.zip) (40GB compressed, 70GB uncompressed) and extract it into `data/raw/` directory

## Usage : Instructions for Running the Denoisers

### For Non-Deep Learning Denoisers:
1. Run the Python script `run.py` or the Jupyter notebook `run.ipynb`.
2. Specify the `denoiser_name` parameter to select a denoising method.
3. After denoising is complete:
   - A `.csv` file containing metrics is saved in `data/output/<denoiser_name>/`.
   - The denoised images are stored in `data/processed/<denoiser_name>/`.

### For Deep Learning Denoisers:

#### **Noise2Noise**:
1. **To train the model**:
   - Convert the dataset to `.h5` format using `convert_dataset_to_h5.py`.
   - Edit `config.json` to update training parameters.
   - Train the model with:
     ```bash
     python train.py -d [device]
     ```
   - Launch TensorBoard to monitor the training process (see [Running TensorBoard](#running-tensorboard)).
   - After training, a `checkpoints.pth` file with the model weights is generated.
2. **To evaluate the model**:
   - Run `run.py` or `run.ipynb` with `denoiser_name = 'Noise2Noise'`.

#### **Noise2Void**:
1. **To train and evaluate the model**:
   - Use the Python script `train_n2v.py` or the Jupyter notebook `train_n2v.ipynb`.
   - The results of the denoised images will appear after the training completes.
2. **Note**: Training `Noise2Void` hasn't been tested properly due to difficulties encountered with [CAREAmics](https://careamics.github.io/0.1/) library.

## Results and Metrics

The results are stored in the `data/output/` directory and include:

- Channel-wise and average metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) in CSV format.  
- Visualizations of denoised images for qualitative comparison.  

### **Metrics Used:**
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Measures the quality of denoised images.  
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: Evaluates the structural fidelity.  

Explore the results using the `explorations.ipynb` notebook in the `scripts/` folder.
